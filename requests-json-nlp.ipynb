    "# Sentiment Analysis on Song Lyrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we performed **sentiment analysis** on the lyrics of the song **\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\"** by **They Might Be Giants** using the **TextBlob** library. The goal was to determine the emotional tone of the song, based on the polarity of its lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Song Lyrics**: We fetched the song lyrics using the Genius API and stored them in a JSON file (`song_data.json`).\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The song lyrics were then analyzed using **TextBlob**, which calculates the **polarity score** of the text.\n",
    "3. **Interpret Results**: Based on the polarity score, we interpreted the sentiment of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song Found**: \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" by They Might Be Giants\n",
    "- **Polarity Score**: `-0.046875`\n",
    "- **Sentiment**: Negative\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: The lyrics have a slightly **negative** connotation, as indicated by the polarity score, which ranges from **-1.0** (very negative) to **1.0** (very positive). The small negative score suggests that the lyrics convey a mild melancholic or introspective mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Interpretation**: Given that the polarity score is slightly negative but not extreme, it can be concluded that the lyrics have a **negative** connotation, but it is not overwhelmingly so. The song may convey themes of introspection or bittersweet emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment analysis has successfully provided insights into the emotional tone of the song's lyrics. With a **polarity score of -0.046875**, the lyrics lean slightly negative, which reflects a nuanced emotional message in the song."
