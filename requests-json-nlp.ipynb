    "# Sentiment Analysis on Song Lyrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we performed **sentiment analysis** on the lyrics of the song **\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\"** by **They Might Be Giants** using the **TextBlob** library. The goal was to determine the emotional tone of the song, based on the polarity of its lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Song Lyrics**: We fetched the song lyrics using the Genius API and stored them in a JSON file (`song_data.json`).\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The song lyrics were then analyzed using **TextBlob**, which calculates the **polarity score** of the text.\n",
    "3. **Interpret Results**: Based on the polarity score, we interpreted the sentiment of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song Found**: \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" by They Might Be Giants\n",
    "- **Polarity Score**: `-0.046875`\n",
    "- **Sentiment**: Negative\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: The lyrics have a slightly **negative** connotation, as indicated by the polarity score, which ranges from **-1.0** (very negative) to **1.0** (very positive). The small negative score suggests that the lyrics convey a mild melancholic or introspective mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Interpretation**: Given that the polarity score is slightly negative but not extreme, it can be concluded that the lyrics have a **negative** connotation, but it is not overwhelmingly so. The song may convey themes of introspection or bittersweet emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment analysis has successfully provided insights into the emotional tone of the song's lyrics. With a **polarity score of -0.046875**, the lyrics lean slightly negative, which reflects a nuanced emotional message in the song."

    "- **Yellow by Coldplay**: 1.00\n",
    "- **Love Story by Taylor Swift**: 1.00\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **polarity scores** from VADER all show a perfect **positive sentiment (1.00)**, but this result does not match the expected sentiment based on the emotional context of the song lyrics. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context and Emotions**:\n",
    "   - **VADER** works well for analyzing social media-like text, but it struggles with more **complex emotional nuances** found in song lyrics. For example, \"Someone Like You\" by Adele is a **sad ballad**, but VADER may not fully capture the depth of loss and melancholy in its lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Song Length**:\n",
    "   - A song's lyrics may include **multiple emotional shifts** (from positive to negative or vice versa), and VADER might not differentiate these shifts effectively, leading to a singular positive polarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplistic Analysis**:\n",
    "   - VADER is a **lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool**. It does not handle things like **sarcasm, cultural context, or metaphorical language** well. For example, phrases like \"I’m not the one for you\" might have a **negative tone**, but the tool might still tag it as **positive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Expected Results**:\n",
    "   - **\"Someone Like You\"**: A more accurate polarity score would be **negative** due to its emotional lyrics.\n",
    "   - **\"Shape of You\"**: Would likely have a **positive polarity**, though not as extreme as 1.00.\n",
    "   - **\"Yellow\"**: Likely to have a **mild positive polarity** (but not perfect 1.00).\n",
    "   - **\"Love Story\"**: Expected to have a **positive polarity**, but again not 1.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While the **VADER tool** has successfully provided sentiment analysis for each song, the results don't perfectly align with the **emotional tones** of the songs. To improve accuracy, you could consider using more sophisticated methods, like **transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)**, or even **fine-tuning** existing models on specific song lyric datasets."
